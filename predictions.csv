"The Black Lives Matter movement has been at the forefront of a good bit conversations for a while, and unfortunately, there are many who still misunderstand the movement's message.Black Lives Matter is not saying that only black lives matter - rather, it's a call to action for all of us to recognize the systemic racism and discrimination that black people face on a daily basis. It's about advocating for justice, equality, and accountability for those who perpetrate violence against the black community.It's important to acknowledge the harsh reality that black people are disproportionately affected by police brutality and other forms of injustice. We cannot ignore the fact that these issues exist and need to be addressed. Saying Black Lives Matter does not mean other lives don't matter - it's simply a reminder that we must work together to ensure that black lives are treated with the same value and respect as any other life.Let's come together to support the Black Lives Matter movement and work towards creating a more just and equitable society for everyone. Remember, all lives will truly matter once black lives matter. #BlackLivesMatter #JusticeForAll",low,low

"In the UK, Johnny Depp was suing NGN who produce The Sun Newspaper, based upon an article written by Dan Wooton. NGN then had to prove it was 'substantally true' to the requisite civil standard and it was them that the burden of proof fell upon. Mr Justice Nichol ruled that 12/14 instances were more likely than not on the balance of probabilities to have occurred  according to the requirement for civil standard in cases of this type.   Therefore, NGN had not committed libel based upon this evidence they presented in their 'truth defence' at this trial. It should be reminded that it was not a criminal trial where it would have to be proved 'beyond any reasonable doubt' under a very different criteria.    Justice Nicol was not there to prove something categorically happened. He was not there and was there to assess whether the newspaper committed defamation based upon the evidence presented.",low,middle

"What is Hero of Bitcoin?Scheduled to launch in late 2023, Hero of Bitcoin is a video game that gets developed for the original GameBoy, Windows PCs, and Android phones. It’s a simple side-scrolling platformer which brings back that nostalgic Mario Land feeling from the GameBoy days, but adds an El Salvadorian Bitcoin charm on top.The story is centered around the idea of mid-life crisis and finding purpose in protecting Bitcoin against evil bankers and “poo coiners”. Hero of Bitcoin also features pixelated representations of prominent bitcoiners, who guide the protagonist along his mission. It’s a one-man labor of love that you can support on Geyser with Lightning donations – the greatest perk being that of receiving a physical copy of the game and having your name included in the credits 😱#heroofbitcoin #gameboy #gameboycolor #gameboyadvance #gameboyadvancesp #newgameboygames #bitcoin #bitcoingame #bitcoingames #bitcoinpodcast #bitcointakeoverpodcast #bitcointakeover #btctkvr #geyserfund #donatebitcoin",low,low

The mathematician, scientist, astrologer, and consultant to the Queen was responsible for many accomplishments in his lifetime, including playing a critical role in the implementation of the gold standard.The gold standard at the time was based on the exchange rate between gold coins and pounds sterling. The goal was to stabilize prices and make trade easier by simplifying the exchange rate. Foreign coins of different values were not accepted in England as universal currency, meaning trade could be difficult. Along with other respected figures in the mid-16th century circle, including Thomas Gresham, Dee played an integral role in the creation of the gold standard.",low,low

"#Bitcoin history: On January 24, 2010, a member named Sabunir on the BitcoinTalk forum made history by attempting to sell a picture for 500 #BTC, marking the first-ever attempt to use Bitcoin as a means of payment. The user wanted to test Bitcoin and see if they could earn $1 from the sale, which was roughly equivalent to 500 BTC at that time‼️ Despite discussions and debates about the technical implementation and feasibility of such a purchase, the offer was not well-received. Nevertheless, on February 24, 2010, two BTC transactions totaling 600 BTC were sent to the wallet provided by Sabunir, currently valued at over $16 million. It remains unclear whether the pioneer actually sold their picture or what their identity is. However, it is known that the anonymous Bitcoiner withdrew the received coins from the wallet a year later! 👇🏻Source:",middle,middle

As one of the early pioneers who witnessed the humble beginnings of Bitcoin, he understands the challenges faced when mining on GPUs in 2011, when the price per coin was a mere $0.50. Most paid the hefty electricity bills, as it was the best solution available.Today, however, we stand at a crossroads. The evolution of blockchain technology has presented us with a better way—a way to secure networks, save the environment, and reduce our electricity bills. Enter Ethereum and #PulseChain, the heralds of sustainable innovation.By embracing these secure networks, we can revolutionize the blockchain landscape and pave the path towards a greener future. No longer will we have to compromise our ecological footprint in the pursuit of secure transactions and decentralized systems. Ethereum and PulseChain offer us a powerful alternative, ensuring that we can protect the environment while nurturing our financial aspirations.This is not just a matter of convenience or personal gain; it is a responsibility we bear for the generations to come. By making the switch to sustainable blockchain solutions, we do it for the kids. We do it to provide them with a world that thrives on sustainable technology, where their future is safeguarded, and they can grow and flourish in harmony with a cleaner planet.Now is the time to act. Let us unite in our commitment to sustainability and progress. Let us embrace the innovative solutions presented by Ethereum and PulseChain, knowing that every transaction made contributes to a better world. By harnessing the power of these networks, we can build a legacy of responsible technology use and demonstrate our unwavering dedication to environmental preservation.Together, we have the power to shape a future where blockchain technologies not only secure our financial systems but also contribute to a sustainable world. Join Richard Heart and countless others who strive for change. Embrace Ethereum and PulseChain, and be part of the movement that prioritizes the environment and empowers the next generation.It is our duty to leave behind a legacy we can be proud of—a legacy of progress, innovation, and environmental consciousness.
